He constructed the first web server, the first web browser, and a document formatting standard known as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Following the publication of the markup language in 1991, and the release of the browser source code for public access in 1993, numerous other web browsers were quickly developed, with Marc Andreessen's Mosaic, being especially user-friendly and simple to install, and frequently recognized for initiating the Internet boom of the 1990s.
